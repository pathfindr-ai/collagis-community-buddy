# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `automation_script_v3.py` is the CLI entry point that orchestrates transcript selection, GPT-powered extraction, and Selenium form submission.
- Supporting modules live alongside it: `extract_data.py` handles GPT calls, `fill_form_details.py` automates the portal, and `mappings.py` stores categorisation logic.
- Language-specific transcripts and logs live in `assets/<Language>/`; keep new samples in the matching folder and retain the existing naming pattern.
- Build artefacts generated by PyInstaller land in `build/` and distributables in `dist/`; do not edit these manually.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate` isolates dependencies for local work.
- `pip install -r requirements.txt` installs Selenium, OpenAI, Pydantic, and other runtime libraries.
- `python automation_script_v3.py` runs the guided workflow; set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your shell or `.env` first.
- `pyinstaller --onefile automation_script_v3.py` regenerates the standalone binary in `dist/`.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Target Python 3.8+, 4-space indentation, and `snake_case` for files, modules, and functions.
- Group imports as stdlib, third-party, then local. Replace wildcard imports with explicit symbols when touching a module.
- Keep GPT prompt helpers and Selenium selectors descriptive; add brief comments only where flow is non-obvious.
- Validate external inputs through Pydantic models before mutating user data dictionaries.

## Testing Guidelines
- There is no automated suite yet; exercise changes by running `python automation_script_v3.py` against sample transcripts in each `assets/` language folder.
- Record manual verification in your PR description (e.g., language tested, form result, notable warnings).
- When introducing unit tests, prefer `pytest` in a new `tests/` directory and mock GPT calls to control API usage.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Follow `type: short summary` phrasing (`feat: add emergency escalation prompt`, `fix: align common-area mapping`). Reference issues with `Closes #ID` when relevant.
- Keep commits focused; avoid committing generated artefacts or sensitive transcripts.
- PRs should note the motivation, key code paths touched, manual/automated test evidence, and any configuration updates.
- Request review before merging and confirm ChromeDriver compatibility when browser automation changes.

## Environment & Security Notes
- Store secrets in `.env`; never commit API keys or personal data. Share sample transcripts with redacted details only.
- Ensure ChromeDriver matches the installed Chrome version; document upgrades in change notes.
- The automation keeps the browser open for reviewâ€”verify form outputs before closing to avoid unintended submissions.
